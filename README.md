## Project 1: Medical Image Annotation Job

In this project, I created a medical image annotation job using Appen's platform for pneumonia detection. The project involved defining the annotation guidelines, setting up the job on the platform, and managing the annotation process.

## Project 2: AutoML for Pneumonia Detection

The second project focused on building a classification model to classify images of chest X-rays using Google AutoML, an automated machine learning tool. The goal was to detect pneumonia from the X-ray images.
